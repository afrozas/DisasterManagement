# Codefundo++ Disaster Management Portal

This project is designed to be the go-to place in cases of emergencies. Features of the portal include:
- Basic contact information for government emergency services and first aid help details.
- Ability to mark yourself as "Safe", which will notify the people that care about you of the same.
- People can "Watch" other people, to get updated of their status in the aftermath of the disaster.
- A portal where the needy can put up requests for basic needs like clothing, drinking water along with a Google Maps Address.
- The portal will also have section where people in safer regions and government agencies can respond to these requests.
- NGOs and agencies can then deliver the products to that particular address with priority.
