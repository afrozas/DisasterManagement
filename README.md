# CodeFunDo++ Disaster Management Portal

This project is designed to be the go-to place in cases of emergencies. Main feature of the project includes:

#### Primary task:
A clustering algorithm for showing distribution of items requested which helps government agencies prioritize the needs of people
- People can put up requests for basic needs like clothing, drinking water along with a Google Maps Location.
- The algorithm ranks the needs and displays high need items on top along with item deficit forecast.
- People in safer regions and government agencies can respond to these item requests.
- NGOs and agencies can then deliver the products to that particular address with priority.

The portal will also have basic contact information for government emergency services and first aid help details.

#### Secondary task:
Additional goals for the project includes:
- Ability to mark yourself as "Safe", which will notify the people that care about you of the same.
- People can "Watch" other people, to get updated of their status in the aftermath of the disaster
